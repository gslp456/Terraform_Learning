Now, Phani has got to know that Terraform can accomplish whatever he is trying to do in a very very less time. So he decided to learn it. 

Terraform can be downloaded from the hashicorp terraform official website.

The language which we use to write the Terraform file is call Hashicorp Language (HCL)

Before we get to writing these, we need to know how to define infrastructure and how Terraform can identify what we need it to accomplish.

	> Statefiles
